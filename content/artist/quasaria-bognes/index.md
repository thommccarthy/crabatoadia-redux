  Quasaria Bognes is a child of the 22nd century, born at the tail end of The Great Collapse, the darkest period in human history (and that's saying a lot). She grew up in Norway, one of the few places in the world still functioning as a country, and was afforded the privilege of studying the secrets of science and sound. At the age of 18, a Buddhist sloth came to her in a dream and warned of fatal misconceptions in the fabric of time. Shortly thereafter she was drafted for the Intergalactic War II and delivered a brave, albeit flawed, performance during the Battle of Saturn against the Lucadorians. Back on Earth, she became a vagabond on the giant land mass formerly known as the United States of America, bearing witness to a legacy of plastic filth and extinction. She met Rocky Kaminski in his time-traveling garbage truck and the rest is history being remade in the early 21st century. She plays keys, vox, and theremin.
