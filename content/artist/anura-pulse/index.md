biography: >-
  Metazoa is a full-length debut album of songs by Andrea Poulsen inspired by
  the science of life, evolution, and animal consciousness. Throughout the album
  a variety of perspectives are presented: a praying mantis embracing her lover
  to death, a whale on a sacred journey, the last Pinta Island Galapagos
  tortoise personally coming to terms with extinction, and a menagerie of
  prehistoric fauna in our scientific Garden of Eden, “Pleistocene Paradise”.
  Full arrangements reflect an eclectic range of influences such as Brazilian
  guitar, jazz, rock, and world rhythms.


  The project to record these songs coincided with the start of the pandemic and continued at hobby speed in the moments in-between where energy could be spared. Thom acted as recording engineer and creative partner, bringing Andrea's sketches to life in their home studio. Also indispensable to the process was Andrea's cousin Paul, whose drum tracks lay a foundation for feel and structure to convey meaning in each tune. Finally, we knew the record wouldn't be complete without help from Jeremy Keim-Shenk (saxophone) and Will Wright (bass guitar), our bandmates from the sci-fi project Rocky Kaminski.


  T﻿he album is currently available for pre-order on Bandcamp, with a release date set in August 2024.
