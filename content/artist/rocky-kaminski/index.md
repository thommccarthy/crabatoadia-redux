biography: Rocky Kaminski was born in the 1980s and grew up near the perpetually
  burning coal mine fire in Centralia, PA. Strapped for cash in his twenties, he
  signed on to a medical study where they fed him experimental anti-aging drugs,
  "The Fountain of Youth Pill". He has lived through the start of the 22nd
  century, when he met Quasaria Bognes and discovered time travel. Rocky and
  Quasaria have returned to our current timeline to warn humanity of our
  potential fate.
