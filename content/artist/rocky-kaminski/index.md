biography: Born in the 1980â€™s near a perpetually burning coal mine fire in rural
  PA, Rocky Kaminski had few ambitions in life aside from making licks on his
  guitar. Strapped for cash as a young man, he participated in a clinical trial
  for experimental anti-aging drugs that caused him to live well into the 22nd
  century and meet multi-instrumentalist Quasaria Bognes. A time-traveling
  garbage truck transports them to gigs throughout the fabric of spacetime,
  where they dazzle audiences with a band of superpowered musicians, telling
  tales of a future dystopia.
