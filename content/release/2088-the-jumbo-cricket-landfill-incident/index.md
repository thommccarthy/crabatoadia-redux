description: >-
  Rocky Kaminski was born in the 1980s and grew up near the perpetually burning
  coal mine fire in Centralia, PA. Strapped for cash in his twenties, he signed
  on to a medical study where they fed him experimental anti-aging drugs, "The
  Fountain of Youth Pill". He has lived through the start of the 22nd century,
  when he discovered time travel and came back to now to warn humanity of our
  dark future.
